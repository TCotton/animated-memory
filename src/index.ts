    <h1>Get future-ready</h1>
    <p>As a technology leader and engineer, I view programming as a product-centric activity. My expertise encompasses both back-end and front-end development, emphasising serverless, event-driven architecture and systems thinking. On the front-end, I strive for solutions that combine accessibility, usability, and performance. I enthusiastically endorse The Agile Manifesto and the systems thinking and domain-driven approach now prevalent in our industry. Over my career, I’ve played instrumental roles in significant retail tech initiatives including projects for Tesco, Boots, and Sainsbury's.</p

    <p>Most recently, I guided tech teams for NBrown’s SimplyBe and Castle projects.</p> 

    <ul marker-="pen tree open">
        <li>Positioned the fintech project, Castle, to launch with its first customers in January 2026.</li>
        <li>Delivered full platform relaunch of Simply Be in the autumn of 2022; guided three cross-functional squads in creating a React.js/Next.js monorepo from several different repos, resulting in a successful go-live and improvements in platform performance and stability.</li>
        <li>The successful work on the “new web” and the Castle project directly lead to a £181m takeover of NBrown in December 2024.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I was also pivotal in creating Elevaate, which secured £600k in funding and won Startup of the Year at Retail Week Live 2015.</p>

    </p>My experience spans all levels, from infrastructure to the browser</p>
